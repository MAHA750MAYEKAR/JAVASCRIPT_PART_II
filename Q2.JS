// In JavaScript, the comma operator is used to evaluate multiple expressions, returning the value of the last expression. It allows you to combine multiple expressions into a single statement. The syntax for the comma operator is simply a comma (,).


// EXAMPLE:
let a=7,b=6,c=10
console.log(`addition of numbers gives ${a+b+c}`);
